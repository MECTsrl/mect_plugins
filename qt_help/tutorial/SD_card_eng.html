		<h3 class="western">Micro SD card insertion</h3>
		<p class="western">On panels TPAC1007_04 it is possible to insert a micro SD card up to 64 GB (ext3 or FAT format and only partition). First time the 
		following windows appears:</p>
	<p class="western"><img src="SD_card_1.png" name="Immagine234" align="bottom" width="480" height="272" border="0"/></p>
	
	<p class="western">It is possible to choose 4 modes:</p>
	<ul>
		<li/>
<p class="western"><strong>Remind me at next boot:</strong> this windows appears again next boot;</p>
		<li/>
<p class="western"><strong>Ignore it:</strong> ignore and don&rsquo;t show again and mount sd card;</p>
		<li/>
<p class="western"><strong>Use it as main storage (HMI+PLC+LOG):</strong> card is used to store the HMI, PLC application with LOGS. Only with SD card formatted in <strong>ext3</strong>.</p>
		<p class="western"><strong>WARNING:</strong> if card is removed, the application is not present on panel any more. If card is moved on another panel 
		(same model), it starts with application in SD card.</p>
		<li/>
<p class="western"><strong>Use it as data storages (only LOG):</strong> card is used only for LOGS. Maximum size 4GB.</p>
	</ul>
	<br/>
	<p class="western"><strong>In the last two cases, only if the SD card has been formatted in ext3 format, it is also possible to create a swap file to increase the available RAM memory.</strong></p>
	<p class="western">You need to check the "create memory swap file" checkbox and the size of the desired area (16/32/64/128/256 MB). </p>
	<p class="western">The proposed choice is 128MB, equal to the RAM present on the card.</p>
	<p class="western">After selecting the type of use desired, if this option is checked, the preparation of the Swap area will start.</p>
	<p class="western"><img src="SD_card_2.png" name="Immagine234" align="bottom" width="480" height="272" border="0"/></p>
	<p class="western">This can take a long time (about 12 minutes for 128MB) and will only be done once.</p>
	<p class="western">The use of RAM memory and swap area can be checked with the command "free" from the terminal.</p>
